# Pricing Analytics

I did this pricing analytics project, based on a dummy dataset from a company. This is the reason why, I would not be able to upload the dummy dataset or the Power BI files. But, I got some good exposure to Data Cleaning and could recommend some pricing strategies.

## Tools Used
ðŸ‘‰ Python(Pandas)

ðŸ‘‰ MS-Excel(Pivots and Lookups)

ðŸ‘‰ PowerBI(Dashboard)

ðŸ‘‰ MS-PowerPoint(Presentation)



## Dataset

Dataset comprised of Car Insurance policies(40 Columns and 100000 rows)


## Data Cleaning

Some of the data cleaning steps I foolwed are as follows:-

1. Eliminated rows where the 'policy' was in force before the vehicle was purchased

2. Eliminated rows where policy holders were residents of a country more than their age.

3. Eliminated ambiguous 'vehicle purchase date' rows

4. In certain cases, vehicle_age was -1 years...To rectify this watched the dataset closely and found the average vehicle value for vehicle age of 1,2,3 etc. Found that the average vehicle value of 1 year old vehicle was closest to the vehicle with age -1. Hence imputed -1 to 1

5. Eliminated customers where it was impractical for a customer to hold a licence considering his age. In this example below a customer aged 26 years cannot be holding a licence from 25 years.

ðŸ‘‰ Good Y-O-Y growth.

ðŸ‘‰ Insurances written throughout the year reach its peak in March and then descend, hitting bottom in December. This could be due to the approach of the financial year end. Hence Ensure we have marketing campaigns targeting towards engaging customers throughout the year.

ðŸ‘‰ Before the 1st of May 2019, policies who have an exposure less than 1 result in lost net earned premium of Â£2.3M(~12.43% â†“). Check for policies before 1/5/2019 to see if people stopped their policies midway and why?
